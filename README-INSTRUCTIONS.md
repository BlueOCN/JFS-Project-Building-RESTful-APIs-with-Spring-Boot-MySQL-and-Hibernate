# JFS-Project-Building-RESTful-APIs-with-Spring-Boot-MySQL-and-Hibernate
You are tasked with building a RESTful API for a Library Management System using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Hibernate. The API will allow users to manage a list of books. This includes:

- Adding new books to the system.
- Retrieving all books or a specific book by its ID.
- Updating book details.
- Deleting books from the system.
- Using MySQL to persist the data and Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM).

## Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Set up a Spring Boot application connected to a MySQL database.
- Create RESTful APIs for managing resources.
- Use Hibernate and JPA annotations to map Java classes to database tables.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with Spring Data JPA.
- Test your APIs using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to set up and configure a Spring Boot application with a MySQL database.
- Learn to build RESTful APIs using Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.
- Gain experience with Hibernate for object-relational mapping and data persistence.
- Develop skills in testing APIs and validating user inputs.
- Understand how to manage relational data and design REST endpoints for real-world use cases.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Use Spring InitializerLinks to an external site. to generate a new Spring Boot project.
   - Add the following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.
2. Import the generated project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Configure the project to connect to a MySQL database.

### Step 2: Configure MySQL Database

1. Install and set up a MySQL database either locally or on a cloud service.
2. Create a new database for the project, for example, library_management.
3. Update the application.properties file to include MySQL connection details such as the database URL, username, and password.

### Step 3: Define the Data Model

1. Create a data model to represent a book.
2. Include fields such as:
   - id: A unique identifier for each book.
   - title: The name of the book.
   - author: The author of the book.
   - isbn: A unique code for the book.
   - publishedDate: The date the book was published.
3. Configure the data model to be mapped to a database table using Hibernate.

### Step 4: Create the Repository

1. Define a repository interface to handle database interactions.
2. Use the repository to perform CRUD operations, such as saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting book records.

### Step 5: Build the REST API

1. Create a REST controller to expose API endpoints for managing books.
2. Define the following endpoints:
   - GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
   - GET /books/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID.
   - POST /books: Add a new book to the system.
   - PUT /books/{id}: Update the details of an existing book.
   - DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a book from the system.

### Step 6: Validate and Test the API
1. Use input validation to ensure the data provided by users is valid (e.g., title and author should not be empty).
2. Implement exception handling to handle scenarios like missing records or invalid input gracefully.
3. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL to verify functionality:
   - Add books to the database.
   - Retrieve book details.
   - Update and delete book records.
4. Check the MySQL database to ensure data is being persisted and updated correctly.

### Additional Challenges
To extend this project, you can:

- Add more fields to the book entity, such as genre or price.
- Implement search functionality to retrieve books by author or title.
- Establish relationships between entities, such as creating an Author entity and linking it to the Book entity using one-to-many relationships.
- Use Swagger or OpenAPI to document your APIs for better usability.
