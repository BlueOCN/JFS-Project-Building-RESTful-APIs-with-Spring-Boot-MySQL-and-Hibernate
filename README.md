# JFS-Project-Building-RESTful-APIs-with-Spring-Boot-MySQL-and-Hibernate
Create a RESTful API for a Library Management System using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Hibernate. Users can add, retrieve (all or by ID), update, and delete books. MySQL ensures data persistence, while Hibernate handles object-relational mapping. Keep it structured and efficient!
